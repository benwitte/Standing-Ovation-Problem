### Prototype Video (links to Youtube):

<p> I've created a little video demonstrating the latest prototype of the standing ovation model. 
  The purple ball is the "performer," while each cylinder is an audience member, or "agent." 
  A full explanation of how this works is coming, as I'm still tinkering with parameters. </p>
